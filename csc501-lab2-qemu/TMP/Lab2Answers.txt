1.The priority inversion problem could cause that a higher-priority process needs to wait for the completion of a lower-priority process.
      1.Priority inheritance is one approach to address this issue. Please give another approach and briefly describe its idea.
      2.Design a test case to show that your approach can address the priority inversion problem. You should compare the results
      that derived from the original XINU implementation (use semaphore) and that derived from your implementation (use readers/writer locks).
      Put your results in Lab2Answers.txt and your test case program (name it task1.c) in both ./sys and ./TMP

      1.random boosting
      The priority of ready threads holding locks could be boosted randomly and then allowed to run to exit the critical section.
      If the thread doesn't get enough time to exit, it will get another chance later.

      2.



2.Synchronization is a quite complex issue in operating systems. To show your understanding about process synchronization,
you are asked to point out a reader/writer synchronization issue in this pesudo-code: task2_sync_issue.c.
Multiple reader threads can execute this code concurrently by calling do_update.
All the variables starting with global_ are global variables.
You are asked to describe the potential issue caused by the incorrect synchronization
and point out at least one possible thread interleaving that would trigger the problem. Put your answer in Lab2Answers.txt mentioned above.
